- Every resource should have the tag "modified_on" which should have the value of the current timestamp based on the format as YYY-MM-DD
- Autoscaling rules CPU < 10 = scale in, CPU > 80 = scale out
- NSG should only allow incoming traffic from loadbalancer to the backend pool (vmms)
- Set env variables for everything
- Use locals wherever possible to make the code manageable
- Use dynamic block for NSG
- Use map for vm size based on the env name
